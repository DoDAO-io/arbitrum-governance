  shortTitle: Decentralisation
  details: >-
    Decentralized governance distributes power among a broad community, ensuring
    that no single entity has unchecked control and that decisions reflect the
    collective will. This happens through the use of following principles:


    ## Chain Ownership 

    Arbitrum networks, such as Arbitrum One, employ the role of a "chain owner,"
    who functions as the system administrator, overseeing updates and
    modifications. This role isn't defined by the Arbitrum protocol itself but
    is crucial for maintaining and enhancing the system. The chain owner has the
    authority to adjust key parameters, halt transaction processing, and
    crucially, upgrade the contracts that underpin the protocol.


    Upgrades to an Arbitrum chain's core contracts are essential for various
    reasons. They enable the implementation of planned enhancements and they
    will continue to be necessary for future, unforeseen technological
    developments. Moreover, they are critical for addressing any serious flaws
    discovered in the code and for adapting to major updates on Ethereum. Given
    the substantial impact these changes can have, the role of chain ownership
    is significant and must be considered with the utmost seriousness within
    Arbitrum's journey towards greater decentralization.


    ## On-Chain Governance 

    Layer 2 (L2) on-chain governance is essential due to the inherent
    differences in how Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 protocols operate. Unlike
    Ethereum, which is an L1 protocol where changes are made through a broad
    social consensus—essentially, node operators choose to update their software
    and the majority version becomes the 'real' Ethereum—L2 protocols like
    Arbitrum are directly governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum
    blockchain. For Arbitrum to implement upgrades, it's not enough to merely
    update the node software; the underlying Ethereum smart contracts, which are
    not governed by the social consensus of the Arbitrum community but by
    Ethereum, must also be updated. This means that while Ethereum can evolve
    through an informal, community-driven process, Arbitrum requires a formal
    governance structure to authorize and enact changes.

    Theoretically, it's possible for Ethereum to adjust its consensus rules to
    allow L2 upgrades, a concept referred to as "enshrined rollups." However,
    this is not a near-future prospect and would require extensive deliberation
    within the Ethereum community, which is beyond the Arbitrum community's
    control. Thus, the necessity for L2 on-chain governance emerges as the
    practical solution for now, providing a structured pathway for upgrades and
    ensuring that the power to modify the protocol doesn't reside with a
    centralized owner but is distributed across the community. This governance
    ensures decisions are transparent, verifiable, and aligned with the
    collective interest of the network's stakeholders.


    ## Decentralization using $ARB

    The $ARB governance token facilitates decentralized decision-making within
    the Arbitrum ecosystem. By distributing these tokens broadly, often through
    a process called an airdrop, ownership and governance powers are shared
    across a diverse group of stakeholders worldwide, forming what's known as
    the Arbitrum DAO. This group of token holders, and those they designate to
    vote on their behalf, has the collective authority to propose, discuss, vote
    on, and implement changes to the protocol.


    In this decentralized governance model, no single party has overarching
    control. The process is designed to be inclusive and transparent, with the
    DAO having the autonomy to manage the protocol's evolution. Smart contracts
    ensure that the process is followed, allowing time for careful consideration
    and voting on proposals. If a change is approved, there is a safeguard in
    place: users have the opportunity to exit the system with their assets if
    they disagree with the new direction. This system ensures that power is
    balanced and the community has a say in the future of Arbitrum.

    ## Features of Security Council

    The Security Council's dual capacity for immediate action in emergencies and
    methodical upgrades in non-critical situations ensures the network's
    stability and responsiveness to threats, all while remaining accountable to
    the Arbitrum DAO's governance structure.


    ### Emergency Protocol Upgrades


    The Security Council can swiftly implement protocol upgrades in emergencies,
    bypassing the standard governance process. Immediate action in case of
    critical vulnerabilities, without publicizing sensitive information in the
    DAO's governance forum. Empowered to act directly and expediently to apply
    urgent fixes, safeguarding the protocol's integrity.


    ### Governance and Oversight


    The Security Council is obliged to adhere to the Arbitrum DAO Constitution
    and to provide transparency reports post-action. Members are elected by the
    DAO through semi-annual elections, ensuring that the council acts in the
    network's best interests.

    ### Routine Upgrades


    Non-critical updates such as software maintenance and minor improvements.
    These upgrades are subject to a delay period, allowing users the choice to
    withdraw if they disagree with the changes.


    ### Resources


    Detailed information about the Security Council's operations and guidelines
    can be found in the Security Council concept doc. The formal
    responsibilities and limits of the Security Council are outlined in The
    Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. 


    ## Way forward 

    The launch of Arbitrum's governance equips the community with two key
    mechanisms: a decentralized governance model and a swift, controlled upgrade
    path for emergency situations. Looking ahead, the community faces pivotal
    questions about the evolution of this system:


    - Is it possible to achieve even greater decentralization in the governance
    process?

    - What steps can be taken to reduce or even remove the Security Council's
    authority?


    Finding answers to these questions will require ongoing, robust discussions
    as Arbitrum develops and as perceptions of decentralization's risks and
    benefits evolve. Importantly, the Arbitrum governance system has full
    authority over the protocol's future, including the governance model itself.
    This means that the future shape of Arbitrum, including changes to how it is
    governed, rests with the Arbitrum community, ensuring that the network's
    trajectory aligns with the collective vision and values of its stakeholders.
