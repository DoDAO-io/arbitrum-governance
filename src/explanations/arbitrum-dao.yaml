    ## Governance Structure

    The governance framework of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is structured
    around the Arbitrum DAO and the Security Council:


    ### Security Council

    The Security Council consists of twelve members who are chosen through an
    election process by the Arbitrum DAO. This group's primary responsibility is
    to maintain the security and performance of Arbitrum, which includes the
    authority to take urgent measures in extraordinary situations to protect the
    network.

    ### Arbitrum DAO

    On the other hand, the Arbitrum DAO represents the collective of $ARB token
    holders across the globe, along with their appointed delegates. It holds the
    overarching governance responsibilities for the Arbitrum ecosystem,
    including the election and oversight of the Security Council. The DAO has
    the power to shape the council's role through constitutional proposals,
    which can redefine or revoke the council's authority if deemed necessary for
    the community's interest.


    ## Decision Making by Arbitrum Governance

    The Arbitrum governance system holds the crucial role of deciding on
    upgrades to the core contracts of Arbitrum chains that govern the network's
    protocols. These upgrades can be driven by various motivations such as
    performance enhancements, security fixes, or broader ecosystem improvements.

    1. An upgrade could improve the system in some way, like increase its
    decentralization or optimize its performance and lower fees.

    2. An upgrade could fix a critical vulnerability.

    3. An upgrade could address a non-critical decision that affects the
    Arbitrum ecosystem at large.

    4. The Arbitrum DAO is also responsible for authorization of the creation of
    new L2 chains
