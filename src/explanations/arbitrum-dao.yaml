    ## Governance Structure

    The governance framework of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is structured
    around the Arbitrum DAO and the Security Council:


    ### Security Council

    The Security Council consists of twelve members who are chosen through an
    election process by the Arbitrum DAO. This group's primary responsibility is
    to maintain the security and performance of Arbitrum, which includes the
    authority to take urgent measures in extraordinary situations to protect the
    network.

    </div>


    ### Arbitrum DAO

    On the other hand, the Arbitrum DAO represents the collective of $ARB token
    holders across the globe, along with their appointed delegates. It holds the
    overarching governance responsibilities for the Arbitrum ecosystem,
    including the election and oversight of the Security Council. The DAO has
    the power to shape the council's role through constitutional proposals,
    which can redefine or revoke the council's authority if deemed necessary for
    the community's interest.


    ## Decision Making by Arbitrum Governance

    The Arbitrum governance system holds the crucial role of deciding on
    upgrades to the core contracts of Arbitrum chains that govern the network's
    protocols. These upgrades can be driven by various motivations such as
    performance enhancements, security fixes, or broader ecosystem improvements.

    1. An upgrade could improve the system in some way, like increase its
    decentralization or optimize its performance and lower fees.

    2. An upgrade could fix a critical vulnerability.

    3. An upgrade could address a non-critical decision that affects the
    Arbitrum ecosystem at large.

    4. The Arbitrum DAO is also responsible for authorization of the creation of
    new L2 chains

    ## Web3 Layers

    Imagine Arbitrum's stakeholders as a hierarchy of support layers, with the
    web3 user layer at the top:


    1. **Web3 User Layer**: This is where users interact with decentralized
    applications (dApps).

    2. **Web3 App Layer**: Here, you have the innovators and developers creating
    the dApps and tools needed for the web3 ecosystem.

    3. **Layer 2 (L2)**: This layer is made up of the Arbitrum DAO, its
    community, node operators, sequencers, and companies like Offchain Labs, all
    working to advance Ethereum's rollup-based future.

    </div>


    4. **Layer 1 (L1)**: Encompasses the base layers of Ethereum's blockchain.

    5. **Consensus Layer (CL)**: Teams like Prysm contribute here, maintaining
    the agreement protocol of Ethereum's beacon chain.

    6. **Execution Layer (EL)**: Involves groups like Geth who develop the
    software that executes blockchain transactions.

    7. **Research Layer**: This includes experts focused on the latest
    developments in cryptography, economic system design, and governance models.


    ## Participation Options

    The users can choose to participate in the protocol's decisons using one of
    the many participation options such as:

    1. **Choose a Representative**: If you don't have time to vote on Arbitrum
    DAO proposals, you can appoint someone to vote for you. For how to do this,
    refer to "Delegate your voting power."

    2. **Vote Yourself**: If you prefer to have a direct say, you can vote on
    DAO proposals on your own. For the process, see "Vote on proposals."

    3. **Represent Others**: If you're keen on representing the community, you
    can become someone who votes for others. To learn more, check out "Become a
    delegate."

    4. **Engage in Discussions**: Take part in shaping the future by joining the
    conversations on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum.

    5. **Connect on Discord**: Join the "Arbinauts" on Discord to be part of the
