  details: >-
    The voting power of an individual is proportional to the number of $ARB
    tokens they possess. When casting votes, members are encouraged to assess
    proposals based on these values, ensuring that decisions align with the
    DAO's overarching goals. In the Arbitrum DAO, the voting process is designed
    to facilitate community-driven governance through four distinct types of
    votes:


    ### Temperature Check

    A temperature check is an initial voting step within the Arbitrum DAO
    designed to measure community interest in a proposed idea or action before
    it advances through the governance process. This preliminary assessment is
    conducted on the Snapshot platform, a decentralized voting interface. To
    participate in a temperature check, $ARB token holders must possess or
    represent at least 0.01% of the total votable tokens. The purpose of this
    step is to ensure that the community sufficiently supports a proposal before
    dedicating more resources to further discussion and voting. It acts as a
    community pulse-taking measure, enabling the DAO to filter out proposals
    that lack substantial backing, thus streamlining the governance process to
    focus on initiatives with broader interest.

    ### On-chain Vote

    An on-chain vote in the Arbitrum DAO occurs after a proposal passes the
    preliminary temperature check. This vote is conducted on the blockchain via
    Tally, a governance platform, and can only be initiated by $ARB token
    holders with at least 1,000,000 votable tokens. For a proposal to pass, it
    must receive affirmative votes from more than 50% of the voting
    participants. Additionally, constitutional changes require support from at
    least 5% of all tokens, while non-constitutional changes need 3%. These
    specifics ensure that only proposals with substantial community backing are
    ratified, reflecting the DAO's commitment to a democratic and transparent
    decision-making process.
