    The voting power of an individual is proportional to the number of $ARB
    tokens they possess. When casting votes, members are encouraged to assess
    proposals based on these values, ensuring that decisions align with the
    DAO's overarching goals. In the Arbitrum DAO, the voting process is designed
    to facilitate community-driven governance through four distinct types of
    votes:


    ### Temperature Check

    A temperature check is an initial voting step within the Arbitrum DAO
    designed to measure community interest in a proposed idea or action before
    it advances through the governance process. This preliminary assessment is
    conducted on the Snapshot platform, a decentralized voting interface. To
    participate in a temperature check, $ARB token holders must possess or
    represent at least 0.01% of the total votable tokens. The purpose of this
    step is to ensure that the community sufficiently supports a proposal before
    dedicating more resources to further discussion and voting. It acts as a
    community pulse-taking measure, enabling the DAO to filter out proposals
    that lack substantial backing, thus streamlining the governance process to
    focus on initiatives with broader interest.

    ### On-chain Vote

    An on-chain vote in the Arbitrum DAO occurs after a proposal passes the
    preliminary temperature check. This vote is conducted on the blockchain via
    Tally, a governance platform, and can only be initiated by $ARB token
    holders with at least 1,000,000 votable tokens. For a proposal to pass, it
    must receive affirmative votes from more than 50% of the voting
    participants. Additionally, constitutional changes require support from at
    least 5% of all tokens, while non-constitutional changes need 3%. These
    specifics ensure that only proposals with substantial community backing are
    ratified, reflecting the DAO's commitment to a democratic and transparent
    decision-making process.

    Active participation in the Arbitrum DAO means voting on member-submitted
    governance proposals. Following it is briefed how to navigate the voting
    process across different proposal stages:


    ## How to vote for proposals in the "temperature check" stage

    Here's how to participate in the temperature check stage for proposals in
    the Arbitrum DAO:


    ### Step 1: Review Proposals

    Access the Arbitrum DAO governance forum online. Find and select the
    proposal you are interested in. Read the proposal details and the community
    discussion thread thoroughly. Provide your feedback and engage with other
    community members in the discussion to refine the proposal.

    ### Step 2: Vote on Snapshot

    Follow the link to the associated Snapshot poll provided in the forum
    submission. On Snapshot, connect your Ethereum wallet that holds your $ARB
    tokens. Navigate to the Arbitrum DAO space on Snapshot and locate the
    specific proposal.


    ### Step 3: Cast Your Vote

    Proceed to vote on the proposal by following Snapshot's user interface
    prompts. Remember, your participation as an $ARB token holder or delegate is
    vital for the temperature check, as it helps determine whether the proposal
    has enough community interest to proceed to the next stages of the voting
    process.


    ## How to vote for proposals in the "on-chain vote" stage

    Here is how to vote on proposals in the on-chain vote stage using Tally for
    the Arbitrum DAO:


    ### Step 1: Navigate to DAOs

    Visit the Tally website and log in using the wallet to which $ARB tokens
    have been delegated. Make sure the delegation was done before the start of
    the voting period. Once logged in, either go to the "explore DAOs" section
    to find the Arbitrum DAO or click on "My DAOs" if you have already
    interacted with the Arbitrum DAO on Tally.


    ### Step 2: Find the Proposal

    Choose between Constitutional or non-Constitutional AIPs (Arbitrum
    Improvement Proposals) on the Arbitrum DAO's page. Within the selected
    category, look for the proposal you wish to vote on.

    ### Step 3: Vote

    Click on the proposal to view the details, and then cast your vote in
    accordance with your stance on the proposal. Ensure your vote counts by
    participating within the specified voting period. For a proposal to pass the
    on-chain vote stage:

    - It must garner more affirmative votes than negative ones.

    - Constitutional AIPs require at least 5% of all votable tokens to vote in
    favor, while non-Constitutional AIPs need at least 3% of votable tokens to
    be cast in favor for approval.
