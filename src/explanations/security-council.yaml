    ## What are elections?

    The election of the Security Council is a key component of the Arbitrum
    DAO's governance framework, serving as a mechanism through which community
    members can shape the leadership that manages the protocol's security.
    Community involvement in these elections is essential to appoint
    representatives who not only embody the community’s values but also possess
    the specialized technical expertise necessary for the role.

    For members of the Arbitrum DAO, participation in the Security Council
    elections is not just a right but a responsibility that underscores the
    commitment to risk management and the broader goal of progressive
    decentralization. This involvement is critical for sustaining the DAO and
    the technologies under its purview, while also managing expectations and
    perceptions both within the Ethereum community and externally.


    ## Importance of elections

    The significance of the Security Council elections within the Arbitrum DAO
    can be summarized as follows:


    1. **Democratic Representation:** Elections ensure that those responsible
    for the DAO’s security are chosen by the community, upholding democratic
    principles.


    2. **Vigilance and Integrity:** Elected members are tasked with the critical
    role of maintaining the security and integrity of the DAO, aligning with the
    community's trust.


    3. **Alignment with DAO Values:** Regular elections facilitate the selection
    of Council members who embody the values outlined in the DAO’s Constitution.

    4. **Accountability:** The election process provides a mechanism for the
    removal of any member not acting in the DAO's best interests, ensuring
    accountability.


    5. **Adaptive Governance:** By enabling the community to refresh the
    Council's composition, elections help the DAO adapt to evolving challenges
    and needs.

    ## How elections work?

    The working of the Security Council elections for the Arbitrum DAO is
    explained below:


    ### Members of the Council

    The Security Council consists of 12 members split into two halves. Elections
    to appoint members to each half occur biannually. While each member
    typically serves for a full year, the initial group's terms were shortened
    to account for the time between the first election outlined in the
    Constitution and the actual start date of the DAO. The six candidates
    receiving the most votes are elected to the Security Council.

    </div>


    ### Candidacy Requirements

    The candidates must fulfill the following requirements to qualify for the
    position in the security council:

    1. Candidates must belong to the Arbitrum DAO.

    2. Candidates need backing from holders of at least 0.2% of votable tokens.

    4. No more than 3 members from the same organization can be elected.

    5. Candidates must be free of conflicts that could hinder their ability to
    prioritize the DAO's best interests.


    ### Amendments to Election Rules

    Election rules can be changed by DAO members, but not during an ongoing
    election. A Security Council member can be removed if 10% of votable tokens
    participate in a vote with 5/6 majority favoring removal, or if 9 Council
    members vote for the removal. The Constitution is the ultimate authority on
    the DAO’s rules, and any discrepancies between other documents and the
    Constitution default to the latter’s precedence.
