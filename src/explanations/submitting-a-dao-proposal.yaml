    ## How to Structure the Proposal?

    When composing an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) for submission to the
    Arbitrum DAO, it is encouraged to follow the structured format below to
    enhance clarity and facilitate the decision-making process:


    1. **Abstract**: Provide a concise summary of the AIP in two or three
    sentences.


    2. **Motivation**: Articulate the reasons for proposing the AIP and why it
    is beneficial for the Arbitrum community.


    3. **Rationale**: Explain how the AIP is in line with the mission and values
    of the Arbitrum community.


    4. **Key Terms** (Optional, but recommended): Define any specialized or new
    terms used within the proposal that are specific to the context or industry.


    5. **Specifications**: Offer an in-depth description of the platforms and
    technologies that will be utilized. Discuss the reasoning behind design
    choices, including alternative designs and precedents in other projects.

    6. **Steps to Implement**: Detail the actionable steps required to execute
    the AIP, along with estimates of costs, manpower, and other necessary
    resources. For AIPs involving third parties, include the necessary legal
    documentation and procedures.


    7. **Timeline**: Outline key dates, including the start date, milestones,
    and expected completion date.


    8. **Overall Cost**: Present a comprehensive cost analysis for implementing
    the AIP, considering both one-time and ongoing expenses.


    For AIPs that require resubmission after an initial rejection, include the
    additional sections:


    9. **Link to the Previous AIP**: Incorporate a reference to the initial
    submission.


    10. **Reasons for Non-Passage**: Summarize why the original AIP was not
    approved.


    11. **Changes Made**: Specify the modifications made to the AIP in response
    to the community's feedback.


    12. **Additional Information**: Provide more details on the intentions,
    specifics, and implications to aid the community in understanding the
    revisions, thereby improving the likelihood of acceptance. 


    Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the proposal is clear,
    comprehensive, and aligned with the community's expectations, increasing its
    chances of being favorably received. In the diagram below, find the outline
