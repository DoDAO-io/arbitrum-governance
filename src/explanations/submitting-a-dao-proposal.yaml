    ## How to Structure the Proposal?

    When composing an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) for submission to the
    Arbitrum DAO, it is encouraged to follow the structured format below to
    enhance clarity and facilitate the decision-making process:


    1. **Abstract**: Provide a concise summary of the AIP in two or three
    sentences.


    2. **Motivation**: Articulate the reasons for proposing the AIP and why it
    is beneficial for the Arbitrum community.


    3. **Rationale**: Explain how the AIP is in line with the mission and values
    of the Arbitrum community.


    4. **Key Terms** (Optional, but recommended): Define any specialized or new
    terms used within the proposal that are specific to the context or industry.


    5. **Specifications**: Offer an in-depth description of the platforms and
    technologies that will be utilized. Discuss the reasoning behind design
    choices, including alternative designs and precedents in other projects.

    </div>


    6. **Steps to Implement**: Detail the actionable steps required to execute
    the AIP, along with estimates of costs, manpower, and other necessary
    resources. For AIPs involving third parties, include the necessary legal
    documentation and procedures.


    7. **Timeline**: Outline key dates, including the start date, milestones,
    and expected completion date.


    8. **Overall Cost**: Present a comprehensive cost analysis for implementing
    the AIP, considering both one-time and ongoing expenses.


    For AIPs that require resubmission after an initial rejection, include the
    additional sections:


    9. **Link to the Previous AIP**: Incorporate a reference to the initial
    submission.


    10. **Reasons for Non-Passage**: Summarize why the original AIP was not
    approved.


    11. **Changes Made**: Specify the modifications made to the AIP in response
    to the community's feedback.


    12. **Additional Information**: Provide more details on the intentions,
    specifics, and implications to aid the community in understanding the
    revisions, thereby improving the likelihood of acceptance. 


    Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the proposal is clear,
    comprehensive, and aligned with the community's expectations, increasing its
    chances of being favorably received. In the diagram below, find the outline

    Follow along this step to understand how to submit the DAO proposals.


    ## Conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot poll

    Here are the steps to conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot
    poll for the Arbitrum DAO:


    ### Step 1: Post on the DAO Governance Forum

    Draft your proposal, ensuring it aligns with the Arbitrum DAO's goals and
    format guidelines. Go to the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. Create a new
    post and use the provided template to structure your proposal. Feel free to
    add additional context to the template to better explain your proposal.


    ### Step 2: Create a Snapshot Poll

    When your proposal is ready for a temperature check, navigate to the
    Snapshot platform. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Snapshot. Access the
    Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space. Set up a new poll and link it to your forum
    post. The poll should be configured to last for one week and use a simple
    majority to decide its outcome.


    ### Step 3: Engage in Discussion

    Once the poll is created, return to your forum post. Update your post with a
    link to the Snapshot poll so the community can participate. Allow the
    community at least one week to discuss, debate, and vote on your proposal.
    Actively engage with the community and consider their feedback to refine
    your proposal.


    ### Step 4: Review the Results

    If the temperature check does not pass, do not proceed to an on-chain vote.
    Instead, use the feedback to revise your proposal and address community
    concerns in the forum. If the temperature check passes, you can prepare for
    the on-chain voting process. Incorporate any feedback from the forum and
    temperature check discussions into your proposal.


    ### Step 5: Proceed to On-chain Voting

    With a successful temperature check, move on to the on-chain vote using
    Tally. Ensure all relevant feedback has been integrated into the final
    proposal.

    </div>


    ## Submit your on-chain proposal using Tally

    Here are the steps to submit your on-chain proposal using Tally for the
    Arbitrum DAO:


    ### Step 1: Meet the Token Requirement

    Ensure your wallet contains at least 1,000,000 $ARB tokens, which is
    approximately 0.1% of votable tokens. Log into the Tally website with the
    wallet that holds your $ARB tokens. Go to the "explore DAOs" section or
    select "My DAOs" within your Tally profile. Locate and select the Arbitrum
    DAO's page.


    ### Step 2: Select the Governor

    Click on the "Create new proposal" button. Decide which governor you are
    addressing:
         - **Arbitrum Core**: For Constitutional Proposals.
         - **Arbitrum Treasury**: For non-Constitutional Proposals.

    ### Step 3: Preview and Submit

    Name your proposal and provide a detailed description. Add a preview image
    if you wish (this is optional). Verify you are submitting to the correct DAO
    page on Tally. Define the actions that will be executed if the proposal is
    passed, such as transferring funds to a specific address. Review your
    proposal thoroughly. You can save it as a draft or submit it on-chain.


    ### Step 4: Voting Conditions for Passage

    A proposal is considered successful if it meets two conditions:
         - It receives more votes in favor than against.
         - It achieves a minimum favorable vote percentage of the total votable tokens:
           - 5% for a Constitutional AIP.
           - 3% for a non-Constitutional AIP.

    ### Step 5: Stay Engaged and Seek Feedback

    If your proposal passes, celebrate your success! The actions outlined in
    your proposal will be executed on-chain after the specified delay. If your
    proposal fails, but you believe it has potential after revision, gather
    feedback and prepare to resubmit. As the DAO and its governance processes
    are dynamic and evolving, stay active on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum
    or Discord to discuss your proposal and receive input from the community.
