    The current phase of the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program, as of July 2023,
    focuses on fostering the development of decentralized applications (dApps)
    and enhancing the infrastructure and tools that support these applications
    within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


    ## Decentralized Applications (dApps) across Arbitrum

    Applications from all projects building dApps on Arbitrum, including those
    on Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum One, and Orbit are welcome. In addition projects
    seeking innovative dApps in various sectors like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, social
    platforms, DAOs, real-world asset tokenization, track and trace solutions,
    and more are encouraged to apply.

    ### Examples:
      - **Gaming**: Games that encourage onboarding onto Arbitrum Nova and One, including all genres and supporting service providers.
      - **DeFi**: Cutting-edge financial solutions like uncollateralized lending, stablecoins, asset management, insurance, derivatives trading, and related service providers.
      - **NFT**: Innovations in dynamic, gamified, collectible NFTs, generative art, membership passes, and applications in music, sports, or finance.
      - **DAOs**: Initiatives that promote community involvement and build upon existing DAOs within Arbitrum.
      - **Social Platforms**: Decentralized social media and community engagement projects, creator platforms, fan engagement, and loyalty programs.

    ## Infrastructure and Tools

    Applications from projects working on integrations and infrastructure to
    connect the ecosystem through Web3 infrastructure are invited. The
    Foundation encourages projects that include those tools that are built on
    Arbitrum Nova, One, and Orbit.

    ### Examples
      - **User Interfaces Tooling and Infrastructure**: Tools that simplify technical blockchain activities, such as wallets, decentralized IDs, developer tools, DNS support, payment interfaces, and exchange support.
      - **Backend Applications**: Developer infrastructure, high-performance indexing and analytics, storage solutions, privacy and security services, development studios, auditing tools, and related service providers.

    These categories are designed to address the immediate needs of the Arbitrum
    ecosystem by providing targeted support where it can significantly impact
    growth and innovation. Applicants are encouraged to align their proposals
    with these categories and demonstrate how their projects will contribute to
    the overarching goals of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

  shortTitle: Measurement

    Milestones and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are fundamental tools in
    measuring the progress and success of projects funded by the Arbitrum
    Foundation's Grant Program.


    ## Milestones

    Milestones mark crucial progress points in a project, such as finishing key
    development stages or reaching specific goals. They are part of the planned
    targets for grant recipients, marking progress in various project phases.
    The Foundation works with recipients to tailor funding to these milestones,
    ensuring both support for the project's advancement and accountability in
    grant use, with a focus on collaborative success and milestone-based fund
    release.


    ### Submission Guidelines

    When crafting milestones for your grant application, follow these guidelines
    to ensure clarity and effectiveness:


    1. **Identify Growth-Based Milestones**: Clearly outline key growth-based
    milestones that reflect significant development points in your project.


    2. **Regular Interval**: Aim for approximately one milestone every 2 to 3
    months throughout your project's development cycle.


    3. **Periodic Submission**: Be prepared to submit detailed milestones
    periodically in the format specified upon approval, which may include a
    Github repository, a product demo, or a Dune Analytics dashboard, especially
    for milestones concerning user growth.

    </div>


    4. **Content of Milestone Submission**: For each milestone, related to your
    grant request, you should include:
       
    - The specific growth-based milestone and its deliverables.

    - The KPI goal that will be used to gauge success for this milestone.

    - The current progress made towards achieving this milestone.

    - The methodology for measuring the milestone and KPI progress.

    - The anticipated date on which you expect to reach the milestone.


    ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurable values that continuously
    track a project's progress toward its goals. Unlike the binary nature of
    milestones, KPIs enable ongoing performance evaluation. Customized to each
    project's aims, they help the Foundation assess grant impact, offer
    feedback, and spot issues, contributing to a strong, inventive ecosystem.


    Following are some of the examples for KPIs and Milestones:
