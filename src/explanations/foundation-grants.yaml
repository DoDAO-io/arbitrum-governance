    external resources such as websites, blog posts, news articles, or social
    media threads where they can add context and depth to your application.

    3. Pay attention to the quality of your writing; while you don't need to be
    a literary genius, proper spelling and grammar, complete and coherent
    sentences, a professional tone, and direct responses to the prompts are all
    crucial for a favorable impression.
