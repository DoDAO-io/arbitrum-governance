      ## What is Governance?

      Governance is the process by which decisions are made within an
      organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions
      through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's
      shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes,
      though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders.
      Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly
      but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its
      community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through
      these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its
      stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional
      corporate governance.


      ## Progressive Decentralization 

      Progressive decentralization is a process where control of a project
      shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves
      setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community
      members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically.
      This shift involves:

      </div>


      **1. DAO Formation:** Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking
      over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of
      rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint
      for its operations.


      **2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates
      membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are
      eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.


      **3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart
      contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts
      execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless,
      decentralized decision-making.


      ## Components of Progressive Decentralisation

      The level of decentralization for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is
      established by the following elements:


      ### Chain ownership

      Chain ownership refers to who has the power to make changes to a
      blockchain's protocol, like updating its core smart contracts, tweaking
      system settings, or even stopping the system temporarily. Chain ownership
      for Arbitrum One and Nova is managed by the Arbitrum DAO, where $ARB token
      holders and their delegates vote on protocol changes, and a Security
      Council that can intervene in emergencies. This dual governance structure
      safeguards the network, but there are risks if the Council or DAO acts
      maliciously. Despite this, users have a safety net to withdraw funds to
      Ethereum if needed. The governance framework also has the flexibility to
      evolve itself through its own voting processes.


      ### Validator ownership

      Validator ownership pertains to the entities that verify the correct
      functioning of the Arbitrum chains and confirm this on the Ethereum
      mainnet (L1). Presently, only a select group of public entities are
      authorized to validate on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, as part of a
      controlled allow-list you can review. The governance system holds the
      authority to modify this list of validators. The risk here is if all the
      active validators are dishonest and one of them updates the chain with
      incorrect information, it could endanger the security of the system.
      However, the Arbitrum governance has the capability to change who is on
      the allow-list, which includes the power to add new validators, remove
      existing ones, or eliminate the allow-list altogether, thereby potentially
      opening up the validation process.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276925600_components.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Sequencer ownership

      Validator ownership in the context of Arbitrum involves the role of the
      Sequencer, which is tasked with gathering and sequencing users'
      transactions. Right now, this function is centralized, with the Sequencers
      for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova operated by the Arbitrum
      Foundation. The governance system has the authority to appoint new
      Sequencers as needed. The main risk with a centralized Sequencer is that
      it can temporarily delay or reorder user transactions up to 24 hours,
      although it cannot threaten the overall security of the system or
      permanently prevent a transaction from being processed. The current
      structure allows for changes: the Arbitrum governance has the ability to
      replace the Sequencer if the community decides it is necessary through its
      voting mechanisms.


      ### Data Availability Committee (DAC) ownership

      The Data Availability Committee (DAC) is essential for Arbitrum Nova,
      which is an "AnyTrust" chain that depends on a selected group to store and
      provide its data when needed. Presently, a 7-member committee handles this
      task for the Arbitrum Nova chain. The members of this committee are
      publicly listed and can be updated by the governance system, which has the
      power to add or remove members. There's a risk involved; if 6 out of the 7
      members, along with the Sequencer, act against the network's interests,
      they could threaten the safety of the system. However, the governance
      structure of Arbitrum is set up to address such issues, holding the
      authority to make changes to the DAC. This includes the ability to change
      its membership or adjust its influence on the network, ensuring the
      committee aligns with the community's trust and the network's security
      needs.

      ## What is Arbitrum DAO 

      The Arbitrum DAO is a collective that governs the Arbitrum ecosystem,
      which operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It represents the
      interests of $ARB token holders, enabling them to shape the ecosystem by
      proposing and voting on Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Governance
      is executed via smart contracts on the Arbitrum One rollup, a Layer 2
      solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability. It is a pivotal structure that
      empowers decentralized decision-making and the stewardship of the Arbitrum
      network's future, reflecting the collective will of its participants.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282781379_dao.png"/>
      </div>


      The DAO's treasury, also managed through smart contracts, funds the
      development and maintenance of the platform. Moreover, the DAO oversees a
      Security Council, elected biannually by the members, to address urgent
      security matters swiftly, ensuring the ecosystem's safety and reliability.


      ## Why is it important?

      The transition to decentralized governance of Arbitrum's technology is a
      crucial advancement towards empowering the community to oversee the
      scaling solutions of Ethereum. This development harmonizes the objectives
      of the Arbitrum community with the broader Ethereum community. It is
      important due to the following reasons:


      1. Ensuring that decision-making processes are democratic and reflect the
      collective will, rather than being reliant on a select few.


      2. Holding $ARB tokens signifies a vested interest in the decentralized
      progression of both Arbitrum and Ethereum. Token holders are afforded the
      opportunity to collaboratively guide the expansion and scaling of
      Ethereum's ecosystem.


      3. Being an $ARB token holder places you at the forefront of innovative
      governance models with significant implications for society. It ensures
      that your perspective is valued and permanently recorded.


      ## What is $ARB?

      The $ARB token is a digital asset based on the ERC-20 standard, which
      grants holders the right to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum
      ecosystem through the Arbitrum DAO. This token is created on the Arbitrum
      One rollup chain, which operates as a Layer 2 solution enhancing
      Ethereum's capabilities. $ARB token holders play an integral part to
      oversee the management of the governance protocols and the technological
      infrastructure of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. Token holders
      use their $ARB to vote on proposals that dictate the networks' upgrades
      and the allocation of the DAO's funds.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282804872_arbs_token.png"/>
      </div>


      Voting power in the Arbitrum DAO is proportional to the amount of $ARB
      tokens one holds or controls through delegation. This means that votes are
      weighted based on the number of tokens, with more tokens translating to a
      greater influence on the outcome of proposals. $ARB tokens can also be
      delegated, allowing token holders to entrust their voting power to others,
      which is particularly useful for members who may not be actively involved
      in the day-to-day governance activities. These minting events are also
      subject to governance through the DAO's proposal system.


      ### $ARB vs $Eth

      It is important to understand the similarities and differences between the
      two tokens. 


      **Similarities**

      1. Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.

      2. Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.

      3. Both can be bought, sold, and traded.


      **Differences**

      1. $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.

      2. $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.

      3. Governance of Arbitrum is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart
      contracts, while Ethereum's governance is handled socially.

      4. Holding $ARB gives you the ability to govern Arbitrum, while holding
      $ETH doesn't impact your ability to govern Ethereum's protocol.

      ## What is Security Council

      The Security Council, as established by the Constitution of the Arbitrum
      DAO, is a pivotal entity tasked with safeguarding the Arbitrum ecosystem.
      This council, composed of 12 members, is elected democratically by the
      Arbitrum DAO's members to manage and mitigate risks. Their role
      encompasses enacting both emergency and non-emergency measures to maintain
      the integrity and security of the network, ensuring the ecosystem's
      resilience against threats and vulnerabilities. Through this governance
      structure, the Arbitrum DAO emphasizes a proactive and responsive approach
      to security, entrusting elected individuals with significant
      responsibility in the stewardship of the platform's safety protocols.
