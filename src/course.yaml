      ## What is Governance?

      Governance is the process by which decisions are made within an
      organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions
      through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's
      shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes,
      though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders.
      Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly
      but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its
      community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through
      these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its
      stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional
      corporate governance.


      ## Progressive Decentralization 

      Progressive decentralization is a process where control of a project
      shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves
      setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community
      members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically.
      This shift involves:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276894949_progressive_decentralisation.png"/>
      </div>


      **1. DAO Formation:** Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking
      over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of
      rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint
      for its operations.


      **2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates
      membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are
      eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.


      **3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart
      contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts
      execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless,
      decentralized decision-making.


      ## Components of Progressive Decentralisation

      The level of decentralization for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is
      established by the following elements:


      ### Chain ownership

      Chain ownership refers to who has the power to make changes to a
      blockchain's protocol, like updating its core smart contracts, tweaking
      system settings, or even stopping the system temporarily. Chain ownership
      for Arbitrum One and Nova is managed by the Arbitrum DAO, where $ARB token
      holders and their delegates vote on protocol changes, and a Security
      Council that can intervene in emergencies. This dual governance structure
      safeguards the network, but there are risks if the Council or DAO acts
      maliciously. Despite this, users have a safety net to withdraw funds to
      Ethereum if needed. The governance framework also has the flexibility to
      evolve itself through its own voting processes.


      ### Validator ownership

      Validator ownership pertains to the entities that verify the correct
      functioning of the Arbitrum chains and confirm this on the Ethereum
      mainnet (L1). Presently, only a select group of public entities are
      authorized to validate on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, as part of a
      controlled allow-list you can review. The governance system holds the
      authority to modify this list of validators. The risk here is if all the
      active validators are dishonest and one of them updates the chain with
      incorrect information, it could endanger the security of the system.
      However, the Arbitrum governance has the capability to change who is on
      the allow-list, which includes the power to add new validators, remove
      existing ones, or eliminate the allow-list altogether, thereby potentially
      opening up the validation process.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276925600_components.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Sequencer ownership

      Validator ownership in the context of Arbitrum involves the role of the
      Sequencer, which is tasked with gathering and sequencing users'
      transactions. Right now, this function is centralized, with the Sequencers
      for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova operated by the Arbitrum
      Foundation. The governance system has the authority to appoint new
      Sequencers as needed. The main risk with a centralized Sequencer is that
      it can temporarily delay or reorder user transactions up to 24 hours,
      although it cannot threaten the overall security of the system or
      permanently prevent a transaction from being processed. The current
      structure allows for changes: the Arbitrum governance has the ability to
      replace the Sequencer if the community decides it is necessary through its
      voting mechanisms.


      ### Data Availability Committee (DAC) ownership

      The Data Availability Committee (DAC) is essential for Arbitrum Nova,
      which is an "AnyTrust" chain that depends on a selected group to store and
      provide its data when needed. Presently, a 7-member committee handles this
      task for the Arbitrum Nova chain. The members of this committee are
      publicly listed and can be updated by the governance system, which has the
      power to add or remove members. There's a risk involved; if 6 out of the 7
      members, along with the Sequencer, act against the network's interests,
      they could threaten the safety of the system. However, the governance
      structure of Arbitrum is set up to address such issues, holding the
      authority to make changes to the DAC. This includes the ability to change
      its membership or adjust its influence on the network, ensuring the
      committee aligns with the community's trust and the network's security
      needs.

      ## What is Arbitrum DAO 

      The Arbitrum DAO is a collective that governs the Arbitrum ecosystem,
      which operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It represents the
      interests of $ARB token holders, enabling them to shape the ecosystem by
      proposing and voting on Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Governance
      is executed via smart contracts on the Arbitrum One rollup, a Layer 2
      solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability. It is a pivotal structure that
      empowers decentralized decision-making and the stewardship of the Arbitrum
      network's future, reflecting the collective will of its participants.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282781379_dao.png"/>
      </div>


      The DAO's treasury, also managed through smart contracts, funds the
      development and maintenance of the platform. Moreover, the DAO oversees a
      Security Council, elected biannually by the members, to address urgent
      security matters swiftly, ensuring the ecosystem's safety and reliability.


      ## Why is it important?

      The transition to decentralized governance of Arbitrum's technology is a
      crucial advancement towards empowering the community to oversee the
      scaling solutions of Ethereum. This development harmonizes the objectives
      of the Arbitrum community with the broader Ethereum community. It is
      important due to the following reasons:


      1. Ensuring that decision-making processes are democratic and reflect the
      collective will, rather than being reliant on a select few.


      2. Holding $ARB tokens signifies a vested interest in the decentralized
      progression of both Arbitrum and Ethereum. Token holders are afforded the
      opportunity to collaboratively guide the expansion and scaling of
      Ethereum's ecosystem.


      3. Being an $ARB token holder places you at the forefront of innovative
      governance models with significant implications for society. It ensures
      that your perspective is valued and permanently recorded.


      ## What is $ARB?

      The $ARB token is a digital asset based on the ERC-20 standard, which
      grants holders the right to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum
      ecosystem through the Arbitrum DAO. This token is created on the Arbitrum
      One rollup chain, which operates as a Layer 2 solution enhancing
      Ethereum's capabilities. $ARB token holders play an integral part to
      oversee the management of the governance protocols and the technological
      infrastructure of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. Token holders
      use their $ARB to vote on proposals that dictate the networks' upgrades
      and the allocation of the DAO's funds.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282804872_arbs_token.png"/>
      </div>


      Voting power in the Arbitrum DAO is proportional to the amount of $ARB
      tokens one holds or controls through delegation. This means that votes are
      weighted based on the number of tokens, with more tokens translating to a
      greater influence on the outcome of proposals. $ARB tokens can also be
      delegated, allowing token holders to entrust their voting power to others,
      which is particularly useful for members who may not be actively involved
      in the day-to-day governance activities. These minting events are also
      subject to governance through the DAO's proposal system.


      ### $ARB vs $Eth

      It is important to understand the similarities and differences between the
      two tokens. 


      **Similarities**

      1. Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.

      2. Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.

      3. Both can be bought, sold, and traded.


      **Differences**

      1. $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.

      2. $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.

      3. Governance of Arbitrum is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart
      contracts, while Ethereum's governance is handled socially.

      4. Holding $ARB gives you the ability to govern Arbitrum, while holding
      $ETH doesn't impact your ability to govern Ethereum's protocol.

    title: Security Council
    details: >-
      ## What is Security Council

      The Security Council, as established by the Constitution of the Arbitrum
      DAO, is a pivotal entity tasked with safeguarding the Arbitrum ecosystem.
      This council, composed of 12 members, is elected democratically by the
      Arbitrum DAO's members to manage and mitigate risks. Their role
      encompasses enacting both emergency and non-emergency measures to maintain
      the integrity and security of the network, ensuring the ecosystem's
      resilience against threats and vulnerabilities. Through this governance
      structure, the Arbitrum DAO emphasizes a proactive and responsive approach
      to security, entrusting elected individuals with significant
      responsibility in the stewardship of the platform's safety protocols.

      </div>


      ## Role of Security Council 

      The Security Council plays a crucial role in overseeing the health and
      stability of the Arbitrum protocol and its broader ecosystem. Some of the
      important roles and responsibilities include:

      1. **Critical Risk Management:** Addressing significant risks to the
      Arbitrum protocol and ecosystem.

      2. **Emergency Decision-Making:** Acting swiftly in urgent situations to
      safeguard the DAO's interests.

      ## Voting in Arbitrum DAO

      Voting in the Arbitrum DAO represents a critical function in the
      decentralized decision-making process. It is the means by which $ARB
      governance token holders can have their say in the direction of the DAO's
      actions, from proposing amendments to the DAO's Constitution to deciding
      on the allocation of funds for various projects. This democratic approach
      is fundamental to the decentralized ethos that underpins the Arbitrum
      ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions reflect the collective will of the
      community rather than the desires of a centralized authority.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701355494876_voting_on%20dao.png"/>
      </div>


      ## Importance of Voting

      The necessity of voting lies in several key areas:


      1. **Decentralization**: Voting is the cornerstone of decentralized
      governance. By enabling token holders to vote on proposals, the DAO
      ensures that the power dynamics remain balanced and distributed across its
      member base, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.


      2. **Consensus Building**: The voting process facilitates a fair and
      transparent method for reaching consensus on important issues. It allows
      for diverse opinions to be heard and considered, ultimately leading to
      decisions that are in the best interest of the entire DAO and its
      underlying technologies.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701357701152_imp_of%20voting.png"/>
      </div>


      3. **Responsiveness**: Voting ensures that the DAO can respond swiftly to
      new developments and challenges. As the needs and priorities of the DAO
      evolve, voting allows for the agile adaptation of strategies and the
      implementation of new initiatives.


      4. **Engagement and Ownership**: By participating in votes, members are
      actively engaging with the DAO's governance. This not only fosters a sense
      of community but also gives members a sense of ownership over the DAO's
      future, as they are directly involved in shaping it.
    explanations: voting-on-dao-proposals.yaml
  - key: delegation
    title: Delegation
    details: >-
      ## What is a Delegate?

      A delegate within the Arbitrum DAO plays a vital role in the governance
      process, acting as a proxy for token holders who may not have the time or
      inclination to participate in the frequent and often complex
      decision-making processes. These delegates are entrusted by token holders
      who willingly transfer their voting rights, empowering the delegate to act
      on their behalf in the governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Once in
      position, delegates are expected to vote on proposals and engage actively
      in discussions, represent the interests of their constituents, and
      contribute to the strategic direction of Arbitrum.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:600px;margin-bottom:60px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/delegation_arbitrum_university_615/1701360156997_delegates.png"/>
      </div>


      The role of a delegate is bound by the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO,
      which outlines the ethical and procedural guidelines to ensure that their
      actions are transparent and aligned with the collective will of the token
      holders they represent. Token holders who delegate their votes maintain
      the right to oversee their delegate's decisions and can withdraw their
      delegation at any point. This mechanism ensures that delegates remain
      accountable to their constituents, who can reclaim their direct voting
      power to influence specific proposals that they feel strongly about.


      ## Benefits of being a delegate 

      Becoming a delegate within a decentralized protocol like Arbitrum offers
      several benefits and serves an important role in the governance system:


      **1. Representation:** Delegates serve as representatives for token
      holders who may not have the time or desire to participate in the
      governance process. This ensures that a broader base of interests is
      considered in decision-making.


      **2. Decentralization:** By allowing token holders to delegate their
      voting power, the system becomes more decentralized. Rather than a small
      group making all decisions, power is distributed among various delegates,
      each representing different stakeholders.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/delegation_arbitrum_university_615/1701359995724_benefits_of%20delegate.png"/>
      </div>


      **3. Active Participation:** As a delegate, you can actively participate
      in the governance of the technology, which can be rewarding both
      intellectually and in terms of the potential to shape the future of the
      protocol.


      **4. Impact:** Delegates can have a significant impact on the protocol by
      ensuring that the values of Ethereum and the delegators are reflected in
      the DAO’s decisions. This can affect how the protocol evolves and
      operates.


      **5. Community Building:** By becoming a delegate, you contribute to
      building a strong community. Active governance participation can foster a
      sense of ownership and collective effort among token holders.

    title: Submitting a DAO Proposal
    details: >-
      ## Why Submit Proposal?

      A DAO proposal is a formalized suggestion put forward by a member of a
      Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is a community-led
      entity with no central authority, to make changes or take specific actions
      within the organization's ecosystem. The need for such proposals arises
      from the democratic nature of DAOs, where collective decision-making is
      fundamental. Proposals enable innovation, improvements, and community
      consensus on the evolution of the protocol or organization. They are
      essential for the transparent and equitable governance of blockchain-based
      projects, allowing stakeholders to vote and decide on the deployment of
      shared resources and strategic directions.

      </div>


      ## Types of Proposals 

      There are two distinct categories of AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals)
      within the Arbitrum DAO framework:


      ### Constitutional AIPs

      These are significant proposals that have the potential to alter the
      foundational rules and procedures of the Arbitrum ecosystem. They include
      changes to the text of the Constitution or to AIP-1, which lays out the
      initial rules for the governance process itself. They can also involve
      installing or modifying software on any of the chains within the Arbitrum
      network or taking actions that necessitate "chain owner" permissions,
      which typically means they require a higher level of authority and
      scrutiny due to their impact on the infrastructure and overall operation.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:300px;margin-bottom:20px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/submitting_a_dao_proposal_arbitrum_university_385/1701363083949_types_of%20aips.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Non-Constitutional AIPs

      This type encompasses proposals that are less structural in nature and do
      not involve amending the Constitution or the foundational governance
      document (AIP-1). They are usually operational or administrative, such as
      requests for funds or grants, or they may offer guidelines or disseminate
      information to the community. Non-Constitutional AIPs are generally more
      straightforward and often deal with the day-to-day governance and
      maintenance of the community's projects and initiatives.


      ## Prerequisites

      To submit a proposal in a DAO the following prerequisites must be met:


      ### For a Temperature Check Using Snapshot:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 0.01% of votable tokens
      within the DAO's ecosystem.


      ### For Submitting a Proposal On-chain Using Tally:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 1,000,000 tokens, which
      equates to approximately 0.1% of votable tokens within the DAO's
      ecosystem.


      If you lack sufficient voting power, there is an option to delegate your
      votes to a delegate with enough tokens. The delegate must have the
      capability and willingness to create a proposal on your behalf.

      ## What are Foundation Grant Program?

      The Arbitrum Foundation's Grant Program is a strategic initiative designed
      to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem as per its mission
      statement. Managed by the Arbitrum Foundation and distinct from any grants
      by the Arbitrum DAO, this program aims to disburse funds to projects that
      are likely to contribute significantly to the development and expansion of
      the ecosystem. With a focus on enhancing adoption, strengthening the
      technical framework, and fostering vibrant, sustainable communities, the
      program issues grants in phases, each targeting specific sectors within
      the Arbitrum ecosystem. While the program aligns with and supports the
      DAO's objectives, it is an independent entity, focusing on specific
      opportunities and partnerships to advance the broader use and engagement
      with Arbitrum's technology. Projects not fitting the current phase's
      criteria are encouraged to apply through the DAO's proposal process or
      check back as the program's phases evolve.

      ### Length of Grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is structured as a continuous
      effort with no set termination, featuring an open submission window for
      projects seeking grants, and operates in phases typically lasting around
      three months. These phases continue until the Foundation deems their goals
      accomplished. However, the program does include specified Grant Moratorium
      periods when new applications are temporarily suspended; these pauses in
      grant acceptance are communicated in advance on the program's Notion page.


      ### Eligibility for grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is targeted at projects that
      contribute to, assist with, or support the Arbitrum ecosystem, with the
      scope of eligible applicants determined by the current Phase's focus. As
      these Phases evolve, the particular segments of the ecosystem that are
      invited to apply for grants will also change, ensuring that the program
      remains aligned with the ecosystem's shifting needs and opportunities.
      Projects interested in applying should consult the "Current Grant
      Categories" for the most up-to-date information on eligibility and focus
      areas.
