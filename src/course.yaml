      Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
      code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or
      security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code,
      evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the
      contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal
      of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and
      reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a
      blockchain network.
