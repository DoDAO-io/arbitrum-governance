      "details": "## What is Governance?\nGovernance is the process by which decisions are made within an organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes, though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders. Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional corporate governance.\n\n## Progressive Decentralization \nProgressive decentralization is a process where control of a project shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically. This shift involves:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276894949_progressive_decentralisation.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**1. DAO Formation:** Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint for its operations.\n\n**2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.\n\n**3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless, decentralized decision-making.\n\n## Components of Progressive Decentralisation\nThe level of decentralization for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is established by the following elements:\n\n### Chain ownership\nChain ownership refers to who has the power to make changes to a blockchain's protocol, like updating its core smart contracts, tweaking system settings, or even stopping the system temporarily. Chain ownership for Arbitrum One and Nova is managed by the Arbitrum DAO, where $ARB token holders and their delegates vote on protocol changes, and a Security Council that can intervene in emergencies. This dual governance structure safeguards the network, but there are risks if the Council or DAO acts maliciously. Despite this, users have a safety net to withdraw funds to Ethereum if needed. The governance framework also has the flexibility to evolve itself through its own voting processes.\n\n### Validator ownership\nValidator ownership pertains to the entities that verify the correct functioning of the Arbitrum chains and confirm this on the Ethereum mainnet (L1). Presently, only a select group of public entities are authorized to validate on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, as part of a controlled allow-list you can review. The governance system holds the authority to modify this list of validators. The risk here is if all the active validators are dishonest and one of them updates the chain with incorrect information, it could endanger the security of the system. However, the Arbitrum governance has the capability to change who is on the allow-list, which includes the power to add new validators, remove existing ones, or eliminate the allow-list altogether, thereby potentially opening up the validation process.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276925600_components.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Sequencer ownership\nValidator ownership in the context of Arbitrum involves the role of the Sequencer, which is tasked with gathering and sequencing users' transactions. Right now, this function is centralized, with the Sequencers for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova operated by the Arbitrum Foundation. The governance system has the authority to appoint new Sequencers as needed. The main risk with a centralized Sequencer is that it can temporarily delay or reorder user transactions up to 24 hours, although it cannot threaten the overall security of the system or permanently prevent a transaction from being processed. The current structure allows for changes: the Arbitrum governance has the ability to replace the Sequencer if the community decides it is necessary through its voting mechanisms.\n\n### Data Availability Committee (DAC) ownership\nThe Data Availability Committee (DAC) is essential for Arbitrum Nova, which is an \"AnyTrust\" chain that depends on a selected group to store and provide its data when needed. Presently, a 7-member committee handles this task for the Arbitrum Nova chain. The members of this committee are publicly listed and can be updated by the governance system, which has the power to add or remove members. There's a risk involved; if 6 out of the 7 members, along with the Sequencer, act against the network's interests, they could threaten the safety of the system. However, the governance structure of Arbitrum is set up to address such issues, holding the authority to make changes to the DAC. This includes the ability to change its membership or adjust its influence on the network, ensuring the committee aligns with the community's trust and the network's security needs.\n\n",

          "details": "Decentralized governance distributes power among a broad community, ensuring that no single entity has unchecked control and that decisions reflect the collective will. This happens through the use of following principles:\n\n## Chain Ownership \nArbitrum networks, such as Arbitrum One, employ the role of a \"chain owner,\" who functions as the system administrator, overseeing updates and modifications. This role isn't defined by the Arbitrum protocol itself but is crucial for maintaining and enhancing the system. The chain owner has the authority to adjust key parameters, halt transaction processing, and crucially, upgrade the contracts that underpin the protocol.\n\nUpgrades to an Arbitrum chain's core contracts are essential for various reasons. They enable the implementation of planned enhancements and they will continue to be necessary for future, unforeseen technological developments. Moreover, they are critical for addressing any serious flaws discovered in the code and for adapting to major updates on Ethereum. Given the substantial impact these changes can have, the role of chain ownership is significant and must be considered with the utmost seriousness within Arbitrum's journey towards greater decentralization.\n\n## On-Chain Governance \nLayer 2 (L2) on-chain governance is essential due to the inherent differences in how Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 protocols operate. Unlike Ethereum, which is an L1 protocol where changes are made through a broad social consensus—essentially, node operators choose to update their software and the majority version becomes the 'real' Ethereum—L2 protocols like Arbitrum are directly governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. For Arbitrum to implement upgrades, it's not enough to merely update the node software; the underlying Ethereum smart contracts, which are not governed by the social consensus of the Arbitrum community but by Ethereum, must also be updated. This means that while Ethereum can evolve through an informal, community-driven process, Arbitrum requires a formal governance structure to authorize and enact changes.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:60px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701278771993_balancing_powers.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nTheoretically, it's possible for Ethereum to adjust its consensus rules to allow L2 upgrades, a concept referred to as \"enshrined rollups.\" However, this is not a near-future prospect and would require extensive deliberation within the Ethereum community, which is beyond the Arbitrum community's control. Thus, the necessity for L2 on-chain governance emerges as the practical solution for now, providing a structured pathway for upgrades and ensuring that the power to modify the protocol doesn't reside with a centralized owner but is distributed across the community. This governance ensures decisions are transparent, verifiable, and aligned with the collective interest of the network's stakeholders.\n\n## Decentralization using $ARB\nThe $ARB governance token facilitates decentralized decision-making within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By distributing these tokens broadly, often through a process called an airdrop, ownership and governance powers are shared across a diverse group of stakeholders worldwide, forming what's known as the Arbitrum DAO. This group of token holders, and those they designate to vote on their behalf, has the collective authority to propose, discuss, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol.\n\nIn this decentralized governance model, no single party has overarching control. The process is designed to be inclusive and transparent, with the DAO having the autonomy to manage the protocol's evolution. Smart contracts ensure that the process is followed, allowing time for careful consideration and voting on proposals. If a change is approved, there is a safeguard in place: users have the opportunity to exit the system with their assets if they disagree with the new direction. This system ensures that power is balanced and the community has a say in the future of Arbitrum.",

Immediate action in case of critical vulnerabilities, without publicizing sensitive information in the DAO's governance forum. Empowered to act directly and expediently to apply urgent fixes, safeguarding the protocol's integrity.\n\n### Governance and Oversight\n\nThe Security Council is obliged to adhere to the Arbitrum DAO Constitution and to provide transparency reports post-action. Members are elected by the DAO through semi-annual elections, ensuring that the council acts in the network's best interests.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701279299538_features_of%20council.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Routine Upgrades\n\nNon-critical updates such as software maintenance and minor improvements. These upgrades are subject to a delay period, allowing users the choice to withdraw if they disagree with the changes.\n\n### Resources\n\nDetailed information about the Security Council's operations and guidelines can be found in the Security Council concept doc. The formal responsibilities and limits of the Security Council are outlined in The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. \n\n## Way forward \nThe launch of Arbitrum's governance equips the community with two key mechanisms: a decentralized governance model and a swift, controlled upgrade path for emergency situations. Looking ahead, the community faces pivotal questions about the evolution of this system:\n\n- Is it possible to achieve even greater decentralization in the governance process?\n- What steps can be taken to reduce or even remove the Security Council's authority?\n\nFinding answers to these questions will require ongoing, robust discussions as Arbitrum develops and as perceptions of decentralization's risks and benefits evolve. Importantly, the Arbitrum governance system has full authority over the protocol's future, including the governance model itself. This means that the future shape of Arbitrum, including changes to how it is governed, rests with the Arbitrum community, ensuring that the network's trajectory aligns with the collective vision and values of its stakeholders.",

It represents the interests of $ARB token holders, enabling them to shape the ecosystem by proposing and voting on Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Governance is executed via smart contracts on the Arbitrum One rollup, a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability. It is a pivotal structure that empowers decentralized decision-making and the stewardship of the Arbitrum network's future, reflecting the collective will of its participants.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282781379_dao.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThe DAO's treasury, also managed through smart contracts, funds the development and maintenance of the platform. Moreover, the DAO oversees a Security Council, elected biannually by the members, to address urgent security matters swiftly, ensuring the ecosystem's safety and reliability.\n\n## Why is it important?\nThe transition to decentralized governance of Arbitrum's technology is a crucial advancement towards empowering the community to oversee the scaling solutions of Ethereum. This development harmonizes the objectives of the Arbitrum community with the broader Ethereum community. It is important due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Ensuring that decision-making processes are democratic and reflect the collective will, rather than being reliant on a select few.\n\n2. Holding $ARB tokens signifies a vested interest in the decentralized progression of both Arbitrum and Ethereum. Token holders are afforded the opportunity to collaboratively guide the expansion and scaling of Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\n3. Being an $ARB token holder places you at the forefront of innovative governance models with significant implications for society. It ensures that your perspective is valued and permanently recorded.\n\n## What is $ARB?\nThe $ARB token is a digital asset based on the ERC-20 standard, which grants holders the right to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem through the Arbitrum DAO. This token is created on the Arbitrum One rollup chain, which operates as a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's capabilities. $ARB token holders play an integral part to oversee the management of the governance protocols and the technological infrastructure of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. Token holders use their $ARB to vote on proposals that dictate the networks' upgrades and the allocation of the DAO's funds.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282804872_arbs_token.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nVoting power in the Arbitrum DAO is proportional to the amount of $ARB tokens one holds or controls through delegation. This means that votes are weighted based on the number of tokens, with more tokens translating to a greater influence on the outcome of proposals. $ARB tokens can also be delegated, allowing token holders to entrust their voting power to others, which is particularly useful for members who may not be actively involved in the day-to-day governance activities. These minting events are also subject to governance through the DAO's proposal system.\n\n### $ARB vs $Eth\nIt is important to understand the similarities and differences between the two tokens. \n\n**Similarities**\n1. Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.\n2. Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.\n3. Both can be bought, sold, and traded.\n\n**Differences**\n1. $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.\n2. $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.\n3. Governance of Arbitrum is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart contracts, while Ethereum's governance is handled socially.\n4. Holding $ARB gives you the ability to govern Arbitrum, while holding $ETH doesn't impact your ability to govern Ethereum's protocol.",

The six candidates receiving the most votes are elected to the Security Council. \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/security_council_arbitrum_university_100/1701354370071_working_of%20elections.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Candidacy Requirements\nThe candidates must fulfill the following requirements to qualify for the position in the security council:\n1. Candidates must belong to the Arbitrum DAO.\n2. Candidates need backing from holders of at least 0.2% of votable tokens.\n4. No more than 3 members from the same organization can be elected.\n5. Candidates must be free of conflicts that could hinder their ability to prioritize the DAO's best interests.\n\n### Amendments to Election Rules\nElection rules can be changed by DAO members, but not during an ongoing election. A Security Council member can be removed if 10% of votable tokens participate in a vote with 5/6 majority favoring removal, or if 9 Council members vote for the removal. The Constitution is the ultimate authority on the DAO’s rules, and any discrepancies between other documents and the Constitution default to the latter’s precedence.",

It is the means by which $ARB governance token holders can have their say in the direction of the DAO's actions, from proposing amendments to the DAO's Constitution to deciding on the allocation of funds for various projects. This democratic approach is fundamental to the decentralized ethos that underpins the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions reflect the collective will of the community rather than the desires of a centralized authority.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701355494876_voting_on%20dao.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n## Importance of Voting\nThe necessity of voting lies in several key areas:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Voting is the cornerstone of decentralized governance. By enabling token holders to vote on proposals, the DAO ensures that the power dynamics remain balanced and distributed across its member base, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.\n\n2. **Consensus Building**: The voting process facilitates a fair and transparent method for reaching consensus on important issues. It allows for diverse opinions to be heard and considered, ultimately leading to decisions that are in the best interest of the entire DAO and its underlying technologies.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701357701152_imp_of%20voting.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n3. **Responsiveness**: Voting ensures that the DAO can respond swiftly to new developments and challenges. As the needs and priorities of the DAO evolve, voting allows for the agile adaptation of strategies and the implementation of new initiatives.\n\n4. **Engagement and Ownership**: By participating in votes, members are actively engaging with the DAO's governance. This not only fosters a sense of community but also gives members a sense of ownership over the DAO's future, as they are directly involved in shaping it.",

When casting votes, members are encouraged to assess proposals based on these values, ensuring that decisions align with the DAO's overarching goals. In the Arbitrum DAO, the voting process is designed to facilitate community-driven governance through four distinct types of votes:\n\n### Temperature Check\nA temperature check is an initial voting step within the Arbitrum DAO designed to measure community interest in a proposed idea or action before it advances through the governance process. This preliminary assessment is conducted on the Snapshot platform, a decentralized voting interface. To participate in a temperature check, $ARB token holders must possess or represent at least 0.01% of the total votable tokens. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the community sufficiently supports a proposal before dedicating more resources to further discussion and voting. It acts as a community pulse-taking measure, enabling the DAO to filter out proposals that lack substantial backing, thus streamlining the governance process to focus on initiatives with broader interest.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701358687643_voting_mechanism.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### On-chain Vote\nAn on-chain vote in the Arbitrum DAO occurs after a proposal passes the preliminary temperature check. This vote is conducted on the blockchain via Tally, a governance platform, and can only be initiated by $ARB token holders with at least 1,000,000 votable tokens. For a proposal to pass, it must receive affirmative votes from more than 50% of the voting participants. Additionally, constitutional changes require support from at least 5% of all tokens, while non-constitutional changes need 3%.

Following it is briefed how to navigate the voting process across different proposal stages:\n\n## How to vote for proposals in the \"temperature check\" stage\nHere's how to participate in the temperature check stage for proposals in the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n### Step 1: Review Proposals\nAccess the Arbitrum DAO governance forum online. Find and select the proposal you are interested in. Read the proposal details and the community discussion thread thoroughly. Provide your feedback and engage with other community members in the discussion to refine the proposal.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701358842819_temperature_check.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Step 2: Vote on Snapshot\nFollow the link to the associated Snapshot poll provided in the forum submission. On Snapshot, connect your Ethereum wallet that holds your $ARB tokens. Navigate to the Arbitrum DAO space on Snapshot and locate the specific proposal.\n\n### Step 3: Cast Your Vote\nProceed to vote on the proposal by following Snapshot's user interface prompts. Remember, your participation as an $ARB token holder or delegate is vital for the temperature check, as it helps determine whether the proposal has enough community interest to proceed to the next stages of the voting process.\n\n## How to vote for proposals in the \"on-chain vote\" stage\nHere is how to vote on proposals in the on-chain vote stage using Tally for the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to DAOs\nVisit the Tally website and log in using the wallet to which $ARB tokens have been delegated. Make sure the delegation was done before the start of the voting period. Once logged in, either go to the \"explore DAOs\" section to find the Arbitrum DAO or click on \"My DAOs\" if you have already interacted with the Arbitrum DAO on Tally.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Proposal\nChoose between Constitutional or non-Constitutional AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals) on the Arbitrum DAO's page. Within the selected category, look for the proposal you wish to vote on.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701358883417_on_chain%20voting.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Step 3: Vote\nClick on the proposal to view the details, and then cast your vote in accordance with your stance on the proposal. Ensure your vote counts by participating within the specified voting period. For a proposal to pass the on-chain vote stage:\n- It must garner more affirmative votes than negative ones.\n- Constitutional AIPs require at least 5% of all votable tokens to vote in favor, while non-Constitutional AIPs need at least 3% of votable tokens to be cast in favor for approval.

These delegates are entrusted by token holders who willingly transfer their voting rights, empowering the delegate to act on their behalf in the governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Once in position, delegates are expected to vote on proposals and engage actively in discussions, represent the interests of their constituents, and contribute to the strategic direction of Arbitrum.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:600px;margin-bottom:60px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/delegation_arbitrum_university_615/1701360156997_delegates.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThe role of a delegate is bound by the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO, which outlines the ethical and procedural guidelines to ensure that their actions are transparent and aligned with the collective will of the token holders they represent. Token holders who delegate their votes maintain the right to oversee their delegate's decisions and can withdraw their delegation at any point. This mechanism ensures that delegates remain accountable to their constituents, who can reclaim their direct voting power to influence specific proposals that they feel strongly about.\n\n## Benefits of being a delegate \nBecoming a delegate within a decentralized protocol like Arbitrum offers several benefits and serves an important role in the governance system:\n\n**1. Representation:** Delegates serve as representatives for token holders who may not have the time or desire to participate in the governance process. This ensures that a broader base of interests is considered in decision-making.\n\n**2. Decentralization:** By allowing token holders to delegate their voting power, the system becomes more decentralized. Rather than a small group making all decisions, power is distributed among various delegates, each representing different stakeholders.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/delegation_arbitrum_university_615/1701359995724_benefits_of%20delegate.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**3. Active Participation:** As a delegate, you can actively participate in the governance of the technology, which can be rewarding both intellectually and in terms of the potential to shape the future of the protocol.\n\n**4. Impact:** Delegates can have a significant impact on the protocol by ensuring that the values of Ethereum and the delegators are reflected in the DAO’s decisions. This can affect how the protocol evolves and operates.\n\n**5. Community Building:** By becoming a delegate, you contribute to building a strong community. Active governance participation can foster a sense of ownership and collective effort among token holders.",

Go to the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. Create a new post and use the provided template to structure your proposal. Feel free to add additional context to the template to better explain your proposal.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Snapshot Poll\nWhen your proposal is ready for a temperature check, navigate to the Snapshot platform. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Snapshot. Access the Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space. Set up a new poll and link it to your forum post. The poll should be configured to last for one week and use a simple majority to decide its outcome.\n\n### Step 3: Engage in Discussion\nOnce the poll is created, return to your forum post. Update your post with a link to the Snapshot poll so the community can participate. Allow the community at least one week to discuss, debate, and vote on your proposal. Actively engage with the community and consider their feedback to refine your proposal.\n\n### Step 4: Review the Results\nIf the temperature check does not pass, do not proceed to an on-chain vote. Instead, use the feedback to revise your proposal and address community concerns in the forum. If the temperature check passes, you can prepare for the on-chain voting process. Incorporate any feedback from the forum and temperature check discussions into your proposal.\n\n### Step 5: Proceed to On-chain Voting\nWith a successful temperature check, move on to the on-chain vote using Tally.

          "details": "## The lifecycle of an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP)\nThe lifecycle of the proposal phase for an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is divided into several distinct phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Temperature Check\nSubmit the AIP for initial feedback on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. Initiate a Snapshot poll to measure community interest. The poll, which lasts 7 days, requires a simple majority without a participation threshold. While optional, this phase is a governance best practice and influences the formal vote.\n\n### Phase 2: Formal AIP and Call for Voting\nOfficially submit the AIP on-chain with the required token representation. A 3-day discussion period follows the submission for community deliberation. The AIP must be designated as Constitutional or Non-Constitutional and specify affected chains.\n\n### Phase 3: On-chain DAO Vote\nDAO members vote on the AIP directly on-chain. The AIP must receive more favorable votes and meet a vote percentage threshold: 5% for Constitutional, 3% for Non-Constitutional. An AIP that passes progresses to further phases, while a failed AIP concludes here.\n\n### Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period\nA 3-day waiting period post-vote allows for objections and fund withdrawals. This phase respects the decision-making process by allowing stakeholders time to adjust.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:600px;margin-bottom:40px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/submitting_a_dao_proposal_arbitrum_university_385/1701370214275_lifecycle_of%20proposal.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Phase 5: L2-to-L1 Message\nA message from L2 to L1 confirms the AIP's approval, taking at least 1 week to finalize. This phase links L2 decisions to L1, ensuring immutable record and trust in the DAO's choices.\n\n### Phase 6: L1 Waiting Period \nA 3-day waiting period post-L1 confirmation allows for transaction finalization on mainnet. This minimizes risks and ensures smooth implementation of the AIP.\n\n### Phase 7: Implementation \nThe approved AIP is executed, either directly on L1 or via an L1-to-L2 transaction. Changes remain active until superseded by subsequent AIPs. Extra waiting time can be specified for significant changes, allowing stakeholders to prepare. This ensures stability for Arbitrum DAO and third-party systems during changes.\n",
