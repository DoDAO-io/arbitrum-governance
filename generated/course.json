      "details": "## What is Governance?\nGovernance is the process by which decisions are made within an organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes, though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders. Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional corporate governance.\n\n## Progressive Decentralization \nProgressive decentralization is a process where control of a project shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically. This shift involves:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276894949_progressive_decentralisation.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**1. DAO Formation:** Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint for its operations.\n\n**2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.\n\n**3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless, decentralized decision-making.\n\n## Components of Progressive Decentralisation\nThe level of decentralization for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is established by the following elements:\n\n### Chain ownership\nChain ownership refers to who has the power to make changes to a blockchain's protocol, like updating its core smart contracts, tweaking system settings, or even stopping the system temporarily. Chain ownership for Arbitrum One and Nova is managed by the Arbitrum DAO, where $ARB token holders and their delegates vote on protocol changes, and a Security Council that can intervene in emergencies. This dual governance structure safeguards the network, but there are risks if the Council or DAO acts maliciously. Despite this, users have a safety net to withdraw funds to Ethereum if needed. The governance framework also has the flexibility to evolve itself through its own voting processes.\n\n### Validator ownership\nValidator ownership pertains to the entities that verify the correct functioning of the Arbitrum chains and confirm this on the Ethereum mainnet (L1). Presently, only a select group of public entities are authorized to validate on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, as part of a controlled allow-list you can review. The governance system holds the authority to modify this list of validators. The risk here is if all the active validators are dishonest and one of them updates the chain with incorrect information, it could endanger the security of the system. However, the Arbitrum governance has the capability to change who is on the allow-list, which includes the power to add new validators, remove existing ones, or eliminate the allow-list altogether, thereby potentially opening up the validation process.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701276925600_components.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Sequencer ownership\nValidator ownership in the context of Arbitrum involves the role of the Sequencer, which is tasked with gathering and sequencing users' transactions. Right now, this function is centralized, with the Sequencers for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova operated by the Arbitrum Foundation. The governance system has the authority to appoint new Sequencers as needed. The main risk with a centralized Sequencer is that it can temporarily delay or reorder user transactions up to 24 hours, although it cannot threaten the overall security of the system or permanently prevent a transaction from being processed. The current structure allows for changes: the Arbitrum governance has the ability to replace the Sequencer if the community decides it is necessary through its voting mechanisms.\n\n### Data Availability Committee (DAC) ownership\nThe Data Availability Committee (DAC) is essential for Arbitrum Nova, which is an \"AnyTrust\" chain that depends on a selected group to store and provide its data when needed. Presently, a 7-member committee handles this task for the Arbitrum Nova chain. The members of this committee are publicly listed and can be updated by the governance system, which has the power to add or remove members. There's a risk involved; if 6 out of the 7 members, along with the Sequencer, act against the network's interests, they could threaten the safety of the system. However, the governance structure of Arbitrum is set up to address such issues, holding the authority to make changes to the DAC. This includes the ability to change its membership or adjust its influence on the network, ensuring the committee aligns with the community's trust and the network's security needs.\n\n",

          "shortTitle": "Decentralisation",
          "details": "Decentralized governance distributes power among a broad community, ensuring that no single entity has unchecked control and that decisions reflect the collective will. This happens through the use of following principles:\n\n## Chain Ownership \nArbitrum networks, such as Arbitrum One, employ the role of a \"chain owner,\" who functions as the system administrator, overseeing updates and modifications. This role isn't defined by the Arbitrum protocol itself but is crucial for maintaining and enhancing the system. The chain owner has the authority to adjust key parameters, halt transaction processing, and crucially, upgrade the contracts that underpin the protocol.\n\nUpgrades to an Arbitrum chain's core contracts are essential for various reasons. They enable the implementation of planned enhancements and they will continue to be necessary for future, unforeseen technological developments. Moreover, they are critical for addressing any serious flaws discovered in the code and for adapting to major updates on Ethereum. Given the substantial impact these changes can have, the role of chain ownership is significant and must be considered with the utmost seriousness within Arbitrum's journey towards greater decentralization.\n\n## On-Chain Governance \nLayer 2 (L2) on-chain governance is essential due to the inherent differences in how Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 protocols operate. Unlike Ethereum, which is an L1 protocol where changes are made through a broad social consensus—essentially, node operators choose to update their software and the majority version becomes the 'real' Ethereum—L2 protocols like Arbitrum are directly governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. For Arbitrum to implement upgrades, it's not enough to merely update the node software; the underlying Ethereum smart contracts, which are not governed by the social consensus of the Arbitrum community but by Ethereum, must also be updated. This means that while Ethereum can evolve through an informal, community-driven process, Arbitrum requires a formal governance structure to authorize and enact changes.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:60px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701278771993_balancing_powers.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nTheoretically, it's possible for Ethereum to adjust its consensus rules to allow L2 upgrades, a concept referred to as \"enshrined rollups.\" However, this is not a near-future prospect and would require extensive deliberation within the Ethereum community, which is beyond the Arbitrum community's control. Thus, the necessity for L2 on-chain governance emerges as the practical solution for now, providing a structured pathway for upgrades and ensuring that the power to modify the protocol doesn't reside with a centralized owner but is distributed across the community. This governance ensures decisions are transparent, verifiable, and aligned with the collective interest of the network's stakeholders.\n\n## Decentralization using $ARB\nThe $ARB governance token facilitates decentralized decision-making within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By distributing these tokens broadly, often through a process called an airdrop, ownership and governance powers are shared across a diverse group of stakeholders worldwide, forming what's known as the Arbitrum DAO. This group of token holders, and those they designate to vote on their behalf, has the collective authority to propose, discuss, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol.\n\nIn this decentralized governance model, no single party has overarching control. The process is designed to be inclusive and transparent, with the DAO having the autonomy to manage the protocol's evolution. Smart contracts ensure that the process is followed, allowing time for careful consideration and voting on proposals. If a change is approved, there is a safeguard in place: users have the opportunity to exit the system with their assets if they disagree with the new direction. This system ensures that power is balanced and the community has a say in the future of Arbitrum.",
